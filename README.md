The Odin Project's Web Development 101 Javascript/Jquery Project. 

1. Still having issues with sizing the window when increasing size. 
2. Haven't completed the OPTIONAL section - instead of changing all tiles into one color, changing it to a random RGB. Will attempt to create 3 random number generators and assign each one to 'R', 'G', and 'B'.  
3. JS code needs quite a bit of cleaning up. Still unfamiliar with what clean code looks like.
